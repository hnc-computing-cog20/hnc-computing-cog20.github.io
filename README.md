## The Website

This is the repository for our group's website on GitHub Pages. The site can be used to post info/links about our projects,
as well as host your own personal page(s) for bigging up your own stuff.

Note that GitHub Pages only hosts static websites, so we can't use anything like Django or any fancy front/backend app stuff,
but the site can serve as a hub and also for practicing your HTML/CSS/etc skills.

To make a personal page, make a folder with your GitHub username as the name, and put all your own stuff in there.

### Instructions for use:

1. Go to the directory you want to store your copy of this project, via Git Bash/terminal using the "cd" command.
2. Clone the repository:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/hnc-computing-cog20/hnc-computing-cog20.github.io/`
3. cd into that directory
4. Make a branch for yourself if it doesn't already exist:<br>
`git branch <name_of_your_branch>`
5. Switch to that branch with:<br>
`git checkout <name_of_your_branch>`
6. Do your thing
7. Add your changes to be committed:<br>
`git add *`
8. Make your commit:<br>
`git commit -m "(a short message describing what you've added/changed)"`
9. Push to the repository:<br>
`git push -u origin <name_of_your_branch>`

Any problems or confusion, ask me and I can help you with it.<br>
Git takes a bit of getting used to, but you'll be using it a lot so you'll pick it up rapid.
