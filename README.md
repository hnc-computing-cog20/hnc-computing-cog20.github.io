## The Website

This is the repository for our group's website on GitHub Pages. The site can be used to post info/links about our projects,
as well as host your own personal page(s) for bigging up your own stuff.

Note that GitHub Pages only hosts static websites, so we can't use anything like Django or any fancy front/backend app stuff,
but the site can serve as a hub and also for practicing your HTML/CSS/etc skills.

To make a personal page, make a folder with your GitHub username as the name, and put all your own stuff in there.
